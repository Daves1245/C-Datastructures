How can bst_ins(root, my_struct_instance, comparator) call container_of
to properly use the comparator function pointer?
    Remember:
        - comparator should compare user-defined structs that are containers
            of the struct tree *member variable. Does this mean the only way
            to make bst_ins would be with a macro like the definition of
            container_of?
